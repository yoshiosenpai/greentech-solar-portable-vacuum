## How It Works
1. The LiPo battery powers the DC motor through an MDD10A motor driver.  
2. The ESP32 controls fan speed, monitors battery voltage and temperature, and updates the OLED display.  
3. The solar panel charges the battery via a mini MPPT controller, with LEDs indicating charging status.  
4. The vacuum body and dustbin are 3D-printed, integrating the solar panel on its top surface.
